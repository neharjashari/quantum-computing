# Quantum Computing

These examples contain some of the problems I've worked on as part of my Computer Engineering Bachelor's Thesis named "Cryptography Challenged by Quantum Computers".

## Built with

Python

**Libraries used**
- qiskit
- matplotlib
- numpy
- math
- pandas
- fractions

## Requirements

You need to have Python installed on your machine.

## Contents

- **Quantum Circuit**: Building a simple quantum circuit using qiskit. The circuit contains two quantum gates: Hadamard Gate and CNOT Gate. It runs on a IBM simulator and it prints our the generated circuit.
- **Random Number Generator**: Generating a real random number, using Quantum Computing.
- **Quantum Coin**: The coin throw game running on a Quantum Computer
- **Cracking RSA**: Finding the factors of a given prime number using Shor's algorithm and proving that this algorithm can crack the RSA Encryption using this method.

## How to run

Run any of the programs by typing the following command on the terminal:

`py <file_name>.py`
